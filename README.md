# gradient_pricingtable
A small challenge mainly to practice flexbox <br>
Use gradient colors as background and shadow inset <br>
For buttons I use hover and active style as additional practice, linekd with some original pages, just for fun! <br>
Not very satisfied with UI. Will do better next time! <br>
